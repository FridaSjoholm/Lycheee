#Lychee

##Description
This iOS app is an extension of the [Lyrically Challenged](https://github.com/FridaSjoholm/lyrically-challenged)  web application. Instead of displaying the song recommendations as Spotify widgets this application let's you browse through the song recommendations as youtube clips. The app is built as a iOS front end to a Ruby on Rails backend.
